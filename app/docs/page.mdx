# Welcome to ControlTheStream

Congratulations on joining the future of interactive livestreaming on Base. **ControlTheStream** is designed to bridge the gap between traditional streaming and onchain interactivity without forcing you to change how you work.

Whether you are a solo creator or managing a massive brand, here is how you can turn your viewers into active participants and unlock entirely new revenue streams through direct onchain engagement.

## What is ControlTheStream?

ControlTheStream is an **interaction layer** for your live streams. It allows your audience to engage with real-time, onchain actions that show up directly on your stream.

### Key Features

- **Keep Your Setup**: No need to switch streaming software. Use any livestreaming setup that allows you to set up Dynamic Browser Sources as overlays (like OBS) and stream on any channel you want (e.g. YouTube, Twitch, X..)

- **Onchain Engagement**: Transform "passive viewers" into "active players" who can donate, vote, trade, bet or interact using their crypto wallets. Users can interact via the miniapp on Base App or via the Web App at `controlthestream.tv/<streamer_page>`

- **Real-Time Feedback**: Your stream reacts instantly to viewer actions through a custom browser overlay. Any time somebody sends a tip, a vote, trade or other interactions, a popup will appear on screen.
