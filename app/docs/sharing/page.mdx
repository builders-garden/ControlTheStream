# Sharing Your Brand URL

To get your audience interacting, you need to share your unique ControlTheStream URL.

## The Interaction Link

Every brand has a specific ControlTheStream URL:

```
controlthestream.com/yourbrand
```

You can find it in the **upper right corner** of the Dashboard.

## Where to Share

You can share your link anywhere your audience lives to maximize reach:

### Social Media

Post it on **X (Twitter)**, **Farcaster**, or **Base App** to announce you are live.

> **Note:** On Base App and Farcaster, the URL will render as a special preview that allows anyone to quickly open your miniapp and start watching the livestream.

### YouTube Chat

Pin the link at the top of your live chat for easy access.

### Video Description

Add it to the first line of your stream description for maximum visibility.

## The Viewer Experience

When a viewer clicks your link, the platform intelligently adapts to their device:

### On Mobile

The link can open directly within the **Base App**, providing:
- A seamless, secure onchain environment
- By-default connected Base App wallet
- Instant interaction with onchain plugins

### On Desktop/Web

It opens a high-performance **Web App**:
- Requires wallet connection before interaction
- Full access to all onchain plugins
- High-performance streaming experience

> In both cases, your viewers can **watch the live stream and interact onchain simultaneously**, all without leaving the interface. This ensures that no matter where your fans find you, they are only one click away from controlling the stream.
