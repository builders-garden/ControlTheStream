# Notifications

Stay connected with your audience even when they aren't watching. The **Notifications** tab allows you to re-engage your community by sending direct updates to their mobile devices.

## Features

### Direct Outreach

You can send custom text notifications to any user who has:
- Added the ControlTheStream miniapp within the Base App
- Enabled notifications

### Announce Live Streams

Use this feature to:
- Alert your followers the moment you go live
- Announce a high-stakes poll
- Share important updates with your community

### History Log

Keep track of your communication strategy by reviewing the history of all previously sent notifications to see what messaging works best.

> **Automatic Notifications:** By default, every time you go live, users that enabled notifications on the MiniApp will receive a notification automatically.

## Best Practices

1. **Be timely** - Send notifications when you're about to go live
2. **Be relevant** - Only notify about content your audience cares about
3. **Be concise** - Keep messages short and actionable
4. **Review analytics** - Check which notification types get the best engagement
