# Configure Plugins via Dashboard

Your dashboard is your customization hub. ControlTheStream offers five powerful plugins to drive engagement and monetization. You can activate and configure these to determine how they appear on your OBS overlay.

## Available Plugins

### Tipping

Enable your audience to support you directly. Viewers can send **USDC on Base** along with a custom text message. The overlay will display the tip amount and the message in real-time.

> **Note:** Custom text messages are available only for tips over $5.

> **Warning:** To keep the experience safe and enjoyable for everyone, we apply content moderation and may filter, mute, or remove messages that don't adhere to our community guidelines, including abusive, hateful, explicit, or spam content.

### Bull Meter (Polls)

Create interactive, skin-in-the-game polls. Viewers vote by committing **1 cent of USDC on Base**. The overlay displays live voting, and once the timer expires, the final result is automatically announced to the stream.
