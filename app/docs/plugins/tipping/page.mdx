# Tipping

Enable your audience to support you directly. Viewers can send **USDC on Base** along with a custom text message. The overlay will display the tip amount and the message in real-time.

## How It Works

1. Viewers send USDC tips through the miniapp or webapp
2. Tips appear on your OBS overlay in real-time
3. Custom messages are displayed alongside the tip amount

## Custom Messages

> **Note:** Custom text messages are available only for tips over $5.

## Content Moderation

> **Warning:** To keep the experience safe and enjoyable for everyone, we apply content moderation and may filter, mute, or remove messages that don't adhere to our community guidelines, including abusive, hateful, explicit, or spam content.
