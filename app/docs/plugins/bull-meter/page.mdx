# Bull Meter (Polls)

Create interactive, skin-in-the-game polls. Viewers vote by committing **1 cent of USDC on Base**.
The overlay displays live voting, and once the timer expires, the final result is automatically announced to the stream.

## How to Set It Up

  alt="Bull Meter plugin setup"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "8px",
    marginTop: "1rem",
    marginBottom: "1rem",
    width: "70%",
    boxShadow: "0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)",
  }}
/>

1. Navigate to the **Sentiment** plugin in your dashboard
2. Give your sentiment poll a name, a duration and, optionally, set up a guest that will receive part of the earned amount
3. Click confirm and sign the transaction that starts the poll

## What Your Users Will See

<img

  alt="Bull Meter plugin overlay"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "8px",
    marginTop: "1rem",
    marginBottom: "1rem",
    width: "70%",
    boxShadow: "0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)",
  }}
/>

- The question will stay up in the overlay until the timer ends; at that point the poll will be closed and the bull/bear percentages will be shown
- When a user clicks on the bull or bear button, the manifestation of their sentiment will take the form of a popup on the overlay, stating the sentiment of that user

## How They Can Interact

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "flex-start",
    alignItems: "center",
    gap: "1rem",
    marginTop: "1rem",
    marginBottom: "1rem",
  }}>
  <img
    src="/docs/images/plugins/sentiment/interact.png"
    alt="Bull Meter plugin interaction"
    style={{
      borderRadius: "8px",
      width: "67%",
      boxShadow: "0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)",
    }}
  />
  <img
    src="/docs/images/plugins/sentiment/interact-mobile.png"
    alt="Bull Meter plugin mobile interaction"
    style={{
      borderRadius: "8px",
      width: "33%",
      boxShadow: "0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)",
    }}
  />
</div>

- By clicking on the bull or bear button the user is prompted to sign a transaction that will allocate $1 maximum to the poll.
- The user can spam-click the button they prefer in order to cumulate votes in that direction. Each vote costs $0.01
