# Setting Up Your Overlay on OBS

The magic of ControlTheStream happens through custom browser sources (i.e. dynamic overlays). This allows your OBS stream to "react" to onchain events in real-time, showing popups while viewers interact via the miniapp or webapp.

## How to Setup a ControlTheStream Browser Overlay on OBS

### Step 1: Copy Your Overlay URL

In your Dashboard, find the **Overlay URLs** on the **Overlay tab**. These are unique links generated specifically for your brand.

### Step 2: Add the Multiple Browser Sources

1. Open **OBS Studio**
2. In the **Sources** box, click the **+** icon and select **Browser**
3. Name it something clear, like *"ControlTheStream Popups Overlay"*
4. Paste your unique URLs into the URL field

### Step 3: Match Your Resolution

Set the width and height to match your stream output:

| Plugin Type | Resolution |
|------------|------------|
| Bull-meter poll | 1100x250 |
| Kalshi | 1100x250 |
| Popups | 600x150 |

### Step 4: Stay on Top

Ensure this source is at the **very top** of your Sources list so the interactions appear over your video.

### Step 5: Test in Real-Time

Once you configured the overlays:

1. Click the buttons on the **Overlay Tab** on ControlTheStream
2. Watch a preview of how the different popups will look like on screen
3. Move them around according to your preferences

> **Note:** Each overlay URL is unique to your brand. Make sure to use the correct URL for each overlay type.
