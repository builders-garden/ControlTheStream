# Getting Started: Creating Your Brand

To begin, you'll need to establish your presence on the platform. We use **Brands** to give you professional flexibility and multi-user support.

## Requirements

You must have the **Base App** installed to register.

## How to Setup Your Brand on ControlTheStream

1. Open the Web App at [https://controlthestream.tv/admin](https://controlthestream.tv/admin)
2. Connect your wallet to create your Brand profile (e.g., your company name or project title)

> **Note:** You can edit your brand details later.

### Step 2: Collaborate with Team Members

Once a Brand is created, you can invite multiple team members to help manage the dashboard and stream settings. They can connect through their wallets as you did in the previous step.

**Adding Team Members:**

4. Once on the profile page, click on your username and the address will be copied to your clipboard

The hosts page is used to list and show hosts & guests that present during the livestream. This information and list of people will appear on both the miniapp and Webapp, showing the viewers links to people who are attending your livestream.

**Adding Hosts:**

1. Navigate to the **"Brand"** tab
2. Go to the **"Hosts"** page
